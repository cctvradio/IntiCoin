​Use the following instructions to mine a block. Open your wallet, and make sure your wallet is connected with a node. Your wallet is connected when you see the icon  in the lower right corner of your wallet. The message “Syncing Headers (0,0%)” will disappear once you mine your first block. Close your wallet and create the file inticoin.conf in the folder “%APPDATA%\inticoin\”. Paste the following text into inticoin.conf and save the file.
​rpcuser=rpc_inticoin
rpcpassword=a1b3ed81382d60e71ae159f02
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=11807
listen=1
server=1
​Open your wallet.
Create a .bat file named mine.bat in the same folder where you extracted inticoin-cli.exe and paste the following text into mine.bat.
@echo off
set SCRIPT_PATH=%cd%
cd %SCRIPT_PATH%
echo Press [CTRL+C] to stop mining.
:begin
 inticoin-cli.exe generate 1
goto begin ​
​Save the file.
Execute mine.bat to start mining your first block.
It will take about +/- 30 minutes to mine your first block, depending on your computer hardware.
